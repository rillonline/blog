<p>Ronnie Camberwell mystery. I was so pleased with myself about exploring
magic, but magic has proved to be difficult. Magic has a cost and
although I have figured out what the cost is to Ronnie as a result of
her careless attitude toward magic, I cannot figure out the cost of
magic to the wizard on an ongoing basis. The wizards are just gifted
with the ability to perform magic and beyond that, I don't know what to
do. I've explored the political consequences and that doesn't seem to
hold water. Exile would break a society apart. Inherited magic doesn't
make sense either. So I don't have a good reason for wizards to have the
ability to do magic to hang out together in the Magic Lands. In my mind,
the Magic Lands feel very medieval. Perhaps this is just a trope. On the
other hand, I have always felt there is something cinister about the
place, as if it itself is held fast by a very powerful spell. Who does
the work around here? Are they slaves? There is just no energy or
enthusiasm to write this story. I might have to recast it and I started
to do this by introducing Captain Star Runner into the plot line. I want
to develop something which involves these two characters to write
regularly this winter.</p>

<p>Picture this. Ronnie, our intrepid heroine, is sitting in the great
library of the wizards in the heart of Magic City. (I know. I know.
These names are not very imaginative and need changing, but it is the
best I can do right now.) Anyway, she is sitting in the library not
because she wants to be there but because she is compelled to be there.
The Tribunal of All Wizards (Is this a better name?) has sentenced her
to serve there for some unspecified length of time. She goes to the
library at the pleasure of the Grand Mistress of Wizards who doesn't
like her to begin with. Ronnie is fulfilling her sentence for the misuse
of magic which caused the death of her mentor, Grand Master Awk.</p>
<p>Although Ronnie is unhappy that she must remain in the Magic Lands for
perhaps the rest of her life, she makes the best of being confined to
the library and her living quarters for most of every day. As
imprisonments go in the inhabited galaxy, it is a very lenient sentence.</p>
<p>The wizards did not come up with this punishment without reason. Ronnie
has shown an aptitude for magic. The wizards hope she can learn to read
and understand the books stored in the library which they cannot even
open. Ronnie thinks their hope in her is misplaced. Even if she can open
a book, why do they think she can read an ancient script and make sense
of it. She does not possess these skills.</p>
<p>Neverthe less, she goes to the library and tries to open every book on
every shelf. There are many thousands of books.</p>
<p>Then one day Ronnie lugs a very large volume to the library table by the
window. It has a pleasant view of a garden. She sets the tome down. What
else can she possibly call the book but a tome. It is dusty. Its binding
shows much wear. She wonders just how old this book is and what sort of
a book this is. There are no pictures on the covers. The script on its
binding is beautiful and perhaps contains grains of precious gems. This
is not her expertise either but the script seems to sparkle.</p>
<p>With no expectations at all, she tries to open the book. And it opens.</p>
<p>Ronnie gasps. The librarian, working at his desk across the room, looks
up to see the book open and hurries over.</p>
<p>"Can you read it?" he asks rather breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Can you see the pictures?" Ronnie asks him.</p>
<p>"The page is blank," the librarian responds, puzzled.</p>
<p>"No, it is not," Ronnie says. "It is a beautifully done star chart."</p>
<p>They stand in silence. Ronnie can see it while the librarian cannot.</p>
<p>"A star chart of what?" the librarian finally asks.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Ronnie says. "I would need a modern star chart and a way
to evaluate procession and drift. I don't recognize any of these stars,
but I am not from around this part of the galactic arm. The
constellations look all wrong to me."</p>
<p>"Can you copy the chart?" the librarian asks quickly.</p>
<p>"Let's see if I can," Ronnie says.</p>
<p>Then she smiles. "If this is a map to treasure, I claim it by virtue of
being able to read the map."</p>
<p>The librarian does not see the humor in her claim but hurries away to
get paper and writing implements. He also calls the Grand Mistress and
she comes to hover over Ronnie's shoulder.</p>
<p>After Ronnie's crude representation of the beautiful chart and much
discussion, the Tribunal corrects the star chart for this time period.
They show it to Ronnie.</p>
<p>"It's Planet X," she says, pointing to a particular constellation. I've
been there."</p>
<p>In an earlier unpublished adventure, she and Captain Star Runner visited
this forbidden planet with disastrous results.</p>

<p>prospered. Reading through the Book of Amos, it is clear that only some
were doing well. Granted, Amos was from Judah and the Lord sent him.
Setting aside the question of worshiping God outside of Jerusalem and
the synchronistic character of temple worship in Israel, Amos inveighs
against personal excess and unethical business practices. Israel is
rotten at its core, straying far from the precepts God has prescribed
for the people in their interpersonal relationships and societal
responsibilities for the poor and needy.</p>
<p>It is astounding that twenty-five years after Jeroboam II's death,
Israel fell to the Assyrians. Assyria forcibly deported many to the far
reaches of its empire, effectively dispersing Israel's people so that
ethnic and religious identity of the people evaporated as they were
absorbed by other cultures and religions. Although the land remained,
Israel and its people were absolutely gone except in the prophetic
imagination.</p>
<p>What makes reading Amos so disturbing are the parallels to our own
country and culture. How close to annihilation are we? Could life as we
know it come tumbling down as quickly as it did for the people of
Israel?</p>
<p>Who will stand up and prophesy to the people and will anyone believe
God's prophet? Or are we doomed to repeat the experience of ancient
Israel?</p>

<p>These are the Hebrew Scripture readings for July 14, 2019 in the United
Methodist Church.</p>
<p>I am not preaching, but a friend asked me to find good news in Amos
7:1-17 (the whole chapter). Here's what is going on:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Things are going well in Israel. The economy is humming along.
Business is good. There are no imminent threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Israel has set up a variant of worship within its borders, not
supporting, going to or wanting to worship in Jerusalem in the
kingdom of Judah.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite the good economy and the absence of threats foreign or
domestic, the poor are suffering. Trickle down economics didn't work
then either and many of them are being cheated when they buy goods.</p></li>
<li>
<p>God sends Amos, whose name means <em>burden-bbearer</em> to prophesy.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Amos is from Judah.</p></li>
<li><p>Amos is not a professional prophet. He has not attended prophet
school. (Yes, they had them back then.)</p></li>
<li><p>Amos seems himself as a shepherd and a sycamore tree farmer.</p></li>
<li><p>The Common English Bible (2010) agrees with my Old Testament
professor who insisted that Amos speaks about himself in the
present tense. He still tends sheep and fruit trees.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The word is bad for Israel and particularly Amaniah in this chapter, but
the good news is directed to God's championing the poor. Things are out
of alignment in Israel. That is why God shows Amos the plumb line.
Measure Israel. See how askew it is. It needs to be brought back to
plumb, to act, as Micah puts it, like this: "… to do justly, to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with your God" Micah 6:8b NKJV).</p>
<p>Amos bears the burden of speaking God's word in a foreign country to
hostile audiences. He does it because he is obedient to God's call and
because the people of Israel are God's people, too.</p>
<p>Psalm 82 is subtitled, in my New King James Version of the Bible, <em>An
Appeal to Justice</em>. When we cannot bring things into plumb, we ask God
to do it. We are confident that God will do it even if it is not on our
time table.</p>
<p>The psalmist says"All the foundations of the earth are unstable" (Psalm
82:5c NKJV).</p>
<p>In the Gospel for Sunday, Jesus shows how the good Samaritan behaves
towards the helpless man and declares that he has fulfilled the law to
love his neighbor as himself. The Samaritan was able to do this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tend the injured man's wounds</p></li>
<li><p>Bring him to the inn</p></li>
<li><p>Engage the innkeeper to continue to care for the injured man</p></li>
<li><p>Promised to reimburse the innkeeper for any expense above what the
Samaritan had already paid.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the fix is beyond our individual or collective ability. Then
we appeal to God for the justice we are unable to deliver.</p>
<p>This is not an excuse. It is a reality.</p>
<p>Anaziah and Jeroboam were powerful men. As such, God charged them to
care for the poor and needy.</p>
<p>God's charge has not changed. Providing safe and sanitary conditions for
migrants at our southern border is not a political matter. God has
charged us to care for those who are in need and for the sojourner among
us. It is a question of carrying out the will of God–Thy will be done.</p>

<p>setting a low writing goal and meeting it. Call it childish if you
like, but positive reinforcement is fun.</p>
<p>But I wanted to do something more than just write a first draft and so I
was leery of making a commitment I couldn't keep. Again, seeing a
congratulatory message on my screen is quite satisfying.</p>
<p>Here's what I really want to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Edit my Kearsarge novel. I wrote it as part of <em>Nanowrimo</em> some time
ago and have never finished an edit. I would like to be able to give
it to an editor and create an ebook out of it with a cover and
everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish Kearsarge to my <em>Github</em> site with each chapter as a separate
web page linked together. (Right now, I don't know how to do this. I
am refreshing my knowledge of orgmode and learning new features.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finish writing my memoir piece on Chance so that Cindy can look it
over before I send it off to Joy.</p></li>

<p>January 27th. I primarily wanted to talk to Paul about Nehemiah 8 and if
my analysis of the text was consistent with his understanding of
Nehemiah and its place in the history of Israel. Paul is a thoughtful
student and teacher so I learned a great deal. When Jason joined us
after his meeting, I explored the practicalities of preaching at St.
Luke's. Jason's sermons are about 7 minutes long. I'm used to having
more time to develop my sermon so cutting back to between 700 and 1000
words will be challenging. I am starting to think of this as my flash
sermon as flash fiction stories are no longer than a thousand words.
Here's a basic summary of what we worked out today:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Over 7 days, the people (which includes women and children as well as
men) here the Torah read aloud. There are break out groups where the
Levites translate and instruct small groups of the people.</p></li>
<li><p>It would appear that Ezra reads more than a law code but reads a
great deal of the Torah. If you postulate he read for 3 hours and a
person reads 30 pages an hour and he read for 7 days, that works out
to 630 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>A further postulation is that Ezra started with Genesis and read
through the Torah so that the people heard the entire story of God's
saving work including fetching the people bak from Egypt and entering
the promised land.</p></li>
<li><p>The people are in mourning but they are told to rejoice. This is a
happy story because it is the account of God's faithfulness to the
people, the story of his mighty acts to save.</p></li>
<li><p>Nehemiah prays at the opening of the book that God continues to be
faithful so that the people may not be scattered again.</p></li>
<li><p>St. Paul speaks to the Corinthians about being the body of Christ,
being one body. Each person is important in their own right. The
Corinthians wanted to compete with one another to have the best gifts
but Paul tells them that each person in the congregation is equally
important.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus widens the idea of the congregation to include the captive and
the disabled. All are welcome and all have gifts to share.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a joyful task. The body grows. No one need be afraid.</p></li>
<li><p>Witth 23% of Americans identifying as atheist or of no religion,
there are lots of people to extend an invitation to. Our message is
one of joy, that God's mighty acts continue and that our worship and
community is joyful. We are not here to condemn and to mourn our
shortcomings.</p></li>
<li><p>We are sent out with gladness and singleness of heart to share this

<p>We did have a touch of snow this morning. More slippery than anything
else to say about it.</p>
<p>I've been dealing with a cold or some thing so have given being sick
priority to get done before Friday. It has blown a hole in what I had
planned to do this week. No energy at all. I have made myself walk with
Elwood some as he would be unmanageable otherwise. He has had to be
patient about park times and has done really well.</p>
<p>At a friend's house, Elwood found another dog's play sock and had great
fun with it Unfortunately, when I had difficulty getting up this
morning, he used his mat as a sock and chewed a corner. I have a second
one on order so this one can be sewed. 1000 teal poop bags came today.
They're all contained in one box that is quite manageable as are the
bags so we're set for a good while. I elected not to order rose or green
ones.</p>

<p>Elwood does not care for baking. It means he has to watch from his tie
down and I take forever!</p>
<p>Then on to a festive supper with friends. They had cats–cats who wanted
to play with Elwood’s tail!</p>
<p>Then the service… We went early because our ride had to be at choir
practice. Elwood doesn’t care for classical music in the big church. He
was very antsy. Also, people kept coming over and that made him bouncy,
too.</p>
<p>Then waiting, waiting, waiting while the special music was performed
before the service. I have only encountered this in Jamestown.</p>
<p>Then onto the service itself. I read. Elwood bounced around. I kept
focused on the reading.</p>
<p>Then he laid quietly throughout the rest of the service. Curiously, no
one fetched us for communion.</p>
<p>Then more waiting around for the ride home. I would have had us walk,
but we had stuff to carry.</p>
<p>A late night park (actually, at 1 a.m., and we slept in.</p>
<p>Now we’re off to a.m. service and communion, I hope.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elwood and I have had a busy week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elwood, apparently, has not previously had exposure to church. Having
gone Saturday night, he was able to survive the Cantata at the Methodist
church. He did jump up periodically when everyone else did and when
there was applause.</p>
<p>We are learning other people's cars. I have asked my friends to remember
what worked.</p>
<p>Then there was Wednesday night and Thursday morning ... Elwood found a
traditional Vespers service with chanting and candlelight more than he
could take. He wriggled out of his harness and climbed on the pew and
me. Holding him with one hand, I unbuckled the harness and got it back
on him to settle him back down again. My pewmate said: “I figured out
you didn't want a lighted candle to hold.”</p>
<p>We had practiced resting in the pew alone every day. What I hadn't
planned on Thursday morning was that everyone gets up. Elwood got up,
too. I ended up with the flixileash wrapped around Elwood, the pew and
myself. More practice needed.</p>
<p>We have a new place at the table for doughnuts afterward. We have to sit
far away from the person who comes with dog biscuits in his pocket and
who cannot restrain himself. Children are always better. They know about
rules.</p>
<p>Bible study was also a trial. The children had been in the room with
cookies the night before.</p>
<p>Park is going better.</p>
<p>Elwood prefers the elevator to the stairs.</p>
<p>Today we took a walk, down 2nd Street, up Prindergast, across on 5th and
back down Main. After doing all this walking, Elwood suddenly made a
turn. He had found St. Luke's. He was convinced that was where we were
going. It took a lot of persuading, after a lot of praise, to convince
him to pass it up.</p>
<p>We have elected to go to the late service Christmas Eve. I didn't think
either of us could manage the early one with the pageant. I'm vesting
and reading. Elwood's first time at the lectern. It's not hard--I hope.</p>
<p>I may finally have gotten the reading sitation changed. It is always
announced as Isaiah 35 but it is actually Isaiah 9.</p>
<p>Well, we have some work to do and our final park of the evening.</p>
