This gave me hours of enjoyment
and I discovered many new authors. I was delighted to read the first
story by Steven Saylor about Gordianus the Fixer. Check it out at

&lt;p&gt;I have really struggled with writing my next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;, line 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronnie Camberwell mystery. I was so pleased with myself about exploring
magic, but magic has proved to be difficult. Magic has a cost and
although I have figured out what the cost is to Ronnie as a result of
her careless attitude toward magic, I cannot figure out the cost of
magic to the wizard on an ongoing basis. The wizards are just gifted
with the ability to perform magic and beyond that, I don't know what to
do. I've explored the political consequences and that doesn't seem to
hold water. Exile would break a society apart. Inherited magic doesn't
make sense either. So I don't have a good reason for wizards to have the
ability to do magic to hang out together in the Magic Lands. In my mind,
the Magic Lands feel very medieval. Perhaps this is just a trope. On the
other hand, I have always felt there is something cinister about the
place, as if it itself is held fast by a very powerful spell. Who does
the work around here? Are they slaves? There is just no energy or
enthusiasm to write this story. I might have to recast it and I started
to do this by introducing Captain Star Runner into the plot line. I want
to develop something which involves these two characters to write
regularly this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>writing</category><guid>https://rillonline.github.io/blog/posts/2019/01/magic-is-difficult/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:11:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
