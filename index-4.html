<p>Edited on 2019/09/01 to correct an error with tasks that needed to be
re-scheduled differently in the future.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have been keeping a list of to-dos in a file called "organizer.org".
(I'm not sure if it actually keeps me organized, but I like the idea
of having a list of tasks, especially tasks I might forget about.) At
the top level I have three headlines:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Tasks. These are the one off sorts of tasks that it would be
labor-intensive to categorize.</p></li>
<li><p>Website. This is where I put items related to maintaining my
website (where you are most likely reading this article) and ideas
for writing new articles.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing. Separate from writing for my website, I list longer pieces
here both fiction and non-fiction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My "init.el" file for Emacs has a line in it to display my weekly
agenda view.</p>
<div class="system-message">

<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   (setq initial-buffer-choice 'org-agenda-list)
</pre>
</div>
<p>This agenda view shows my diary for the week as well as any tasks with
either a scheduled start date or end date, i.e., deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-a-good-to-do">
<h2>Writing a Good To-do</h2>
<p>A basic rule of thumb is to write a to-do that you can actually get
done. It has to be specific enough so that you know when you've
started it and when you can check it off your list, that is, mark it
done. I had this to-do which is more an aspiration than a to-do.</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 38)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   ** TODO Publish at least one blog post weekly to keep website fresh
</pre>
</div>
<p>The intent is clear enough: one blog post to be completed every
week.</p>
<p>My mother kept a calendar on the kitchen wall. She was fussy about it.
She wanted big blank blocks in which to write. She wrote everything
down. She had codes for each of us. She often would say the item and
the person's initials as she wrote.</p>
<p>In my mother's calendar world, the blog post could be written in and
even X'ed out when done and then been re-written on the next line of
blocks for the month. She may have even just drawn a straight line
through every Tuesday.</p>
<p>I have several good to-dos already in my organizer file:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 57)</p>

<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   ** TODO Pay rent
      DEADLINE: &lt;2019-09-01 Sun +1m&gt;
   ** TODO Give Nick his heart worm pill
      DEADLINE: &lt;2019-09-13 Fri +1m&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>These tasks can be marked as done. Org will advance the date
by one month and they will again appear in my weekly agenda view. The
day of the week will change, but not the day of the month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-interim-solution">
<h2>An Interim Solution</h2>
<p>I started marking my website refresh to-do as done when I wrote and
posted a new article. After marking it done and recording the name of
the article in the comments, I marked the to-do as "TODO" to start the
process all over again. This seems quite unappealing to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-better-solution">
<h2>A Better Solution</h2>
<p>In reading through
<a class="reference external" href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html">Repeated Tasks</a> I realized that my article writing to-do is not like
paying rent or giving Nick his pill. If I do not write a blog article
on a given week, I don't need to catch up. I can pick up at any time
and start posting on a regular basis. It is clear looking through my
archives and at other people's blogs this is what happens all the
time. I am writing these articles because I want to write them. I
don't need to write them. I enjoy posting and then marking my success
by calling this to-do done. In the days of paper and pen, people
enjoyed drawing a line through an item on a list. (Never using this
medium, I was always jealous of their satisfaction. People wrote
noisily and with a flourish.)</p>
<p>I now find out Org has a solution for my task.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-new-to-do">
<h2>My New To-do</h2>
<p>Here is what I came up with for my article writing to-do.</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 99)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   ** TODO Publish at least one blog post weekly to keep website fresh
      DEADLINE: &lt;2019-08-27 Tue .+3d&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>This suggests I have a 3 day deadline for writing a weekly article.
No, I haven't lost my mind. If I am writing regularly, I will write
more than one blog post a week and I want to honor that, but my
general goal is to be sure I write at least one post every week.</p>
<p>When I mark this task as done, three days will be added to the deadline. If the
deadline is in the past, another three days will be added until the deadline
is in the future. In this way, the three-day deadline may also move
throughout the week. For example, if I complete this task today,
Tuesday, it will have a deadline of Friday. If I don't complete
it until Monday, it will then have a deadline of the following
Thursday, almost two weeks after its original deadline.</p>
<p>If you want this task to always be due on a Tuesday,for example, use
"++"(plus plus) instead
of ".+" (dot plus.)</p>

<p>I wanted to know how much my subscriptions were costing me every
month. Subscription fatigue is a popular topic on tech talk shows so I
wanted to see how my useage stacked up and if there was anything
outrageous I could cut.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools at my disposal:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A Perkins Brailler and a sheet of paper. I still know how to add up
a column of figures manually.</p></li>
<li>
<p>A spreadsheet program. Let me count the options I have, not going
into how well I think they work or how well I know them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft Excel</p></li>
<li><p>LibriOffice Calc</p></li>
<li><p>Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>ses</p></li>
<li><p>dismal</p></li>
<li><p>Org</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not in my little list above, I know word processor programs
have tables and the possibility of formulas, but I decided I could
investigate org tables. I could report on their accessibility with help from Emacspeak.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-a-table">
<h2>Setting Up A Table</h2>
<p>I decided to create a table with two columns, "ITEM" for the name of
the subscription and "ExPENSE" for the monthly amount I am
spending.</p>
<p>There's nothing fancy about setting up an org table. The vertical bar
character "|" delimits columns. If a "|" is the first character in a
line, org understands this to be a table. A two column table with one
row looks like this:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 36)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example


   | | |
</pre>
</div>
<p>But I need a table with two headers, a horizontal rule between my
headings and my subscriptions and one row to start.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You need a header row with a horizontal rule underneath it if you want to total a column of numbers.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Type the line</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 48)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example


   |ITEM|ExPENSE|

<p>Press return. Don't worry about white space</p>

<li>
<p>Type "<a href="posts/2019/08/using-tables-in-orgmode-with-emacspeak/#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">|</span></a>-" (vertical bar followed immediately by a hyphen) and press
tab.</p>
<div class="system-message" id="id1">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 54); <em><a href="posts/2019/08/using-tables-in-orgmode-with-emacspeak/#id2">backlink</a></em></p>

</div>
</li>
<li><p>Now you have a table ready for input.Your column headings have
white space around them and your horizontal rule is filled in. The
vertical bars to define the columns in the new row are in place.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entering-data-into-a-table">
<h2>Entering Data into A Table</h2>
<p>Once the table is set up like this, it is an easy process to fill in many lines of data.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>With point at the third position, type "Amazon Prime".</p></li>
<li><p>Press tab. Point is at the third position after the second "|".</p></li>
<li><p>Type "8.25" for one month of the $99 subscription.</p></li>
<li><p>Press return.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Here's what the table now looks like. Notice that the columns have
been adjusted to accommodate the longer text of "Amazon Prime".</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 79)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   | ITEM         | EXPENSE  |
   |--------------+---------|
   | Amazon Prime |       8.25   |
   |              |              |
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to realize that point is now in the second column.
Either use s=tab to move back one field to the first column or c-a to
go to the beginning of the line and c-f to move to the right of the "|".</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summing-up-expenses">
<h2>Summing Up Expenses</h2>
<p>When I thought I had listed all my subscriptions, I made another
horizontal rule.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I typed the word "Total" in the first column.</p></li>
<li><p>I pressed tab.</p></li>
<li><p>I pressed "C-c +" (c-c then the plus sign). This summed up my
expenses and put it in the echo line.</p></li>
<li><p>I pressed "c-y" to paste (yank) it into the table at point.</p></li>
<li><p>Now I could read the number.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is fine, but if I added another subscription (perish the
thought!) I would have to go through the process of updating the total
more or less manually. I needed a formula that I could rerun at any
time. Who knows. I might even drop a subscription down the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-discoveries">
<h2>Some Discoveries</h2>
<p>I created a much more complicated table with many headings for
different kinds of expenses. Most of every column had white space in
it with a few numbers. This doesn't work in Org. The columns cannot be
summarized. Following the example of<a class="reference external" href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/spreadsheet.html">Lots of Small Spreadsheets</a> I broke
my mammoth spreadsheet into six little ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>subscriptions</p></li>
<li><p>rent and such</p></li>
<li><p>health and wellness</p></li>
<li><p>food and drink</p></li>
<li><p>dog (for my Seeing Eye dog)</p></li>
<li><p>Miscellaneous</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then I created a seventh table to summarize them all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naming-tables">
<h2>Naming Tables</h2>
<p>If each of these tables has a unique name, any field in that table can be
referenced elsewhere in the Org universe. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 132)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   #+NAME: subscriptions
</pre>
</div>
<p>Put this name at the top of the table above the header row. Don't have
any white space in-between this line and the header line. Org needs to
understand they are connected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-org-references-rows-and-columns">
<h2>How Org References Rows and Columns</h2>
<p>To find out where you are in a table, use "c-c ?" (c-c question mark).
To hear the reference again, press "c-e a". You can do this as many
times as you need to until you have it in your mind. I don't know of a
way to put it on the clipboard to be yanked into a text file to be
interrogated.</p>
<p>The readout is in the form line number which is prefixed by the "@" (at sign) followed by the
word "col" followed by the column designation in the form "$" (dollar
sign) followed by the column position followed by the compound
expression of row plus column. Finally, a more conventional
spreadsheet reference. So the field in the seventh row in the fifth column is "@7$5" or "G5".</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-it-altogether">
<h2>Putting It Altogether</h2>
<p>Each of our little tables needs a formula to sum up the expenses
listed in column 2. You write this formula this way:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 161)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>
<pre class="literal-block">.. code:: example

   #+TBLFM: @&gt;$2=vsum(@2..@-1)
</pre>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>"#+TBLFM:" follows the table itself with no white space. I could
not get more than one of these to work per table.</p></li>
<li><p>The left hand side of the equation shows where to put the answer.
Put it in the last row, second column.</p></li>
<li><p>"vsum" is an Emacs calc function. It will summarize the column for us.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the parentheses is the range: from the second row to the
next to last row in the second column. Org does not count the
horizontal lines but it will stop any calculation when it
encounters one.</p></li>
<li><p>Press "c-c c-c" on this line and voila! The total appears.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>*Note*: Always blank out your field(s) before initiating a
calculation. You will get some strange numbers if you don't.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-final-summation">
<h2>The Final Summation</h2>
<p>Finally, I needed to add the totals from the six tables into
the seventh one. Obviously, I could look at each number and copy it over,
but what fun is that? Besides, every time I added an item to one of
the tables, I would have to copy a new number into the correct field.</p>
<p>Enter "#+NAME:" to save the day.</p>
<p>I wrote a formula to pick up the total amount from each table, copy it
to the appropriate line in the second column of my summary table and
add it all up. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the hang of
doing these remote references within the table so I have one huge
"#+TBLFM:" line. It may not be pretty but it works! Here's what it
looks like. It will probably wrap on your screen, but trust me, it's
one line in my file.</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 197)</p>

</pre>
</div>
<p>The double "::" (colon) concatenates each equation to the next. When it
all finally worked, the entire column was filled in and the grand
total appeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-observations">
<h2>Some Observations</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>"C-c spc" is a great keybinding to know. It blanks out a field.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to delete a column or row is useful. Don't be too
zealous. You'll end up wiping out all your hard work entering it.
Moving rows up and down can be accomplished with keybindings, too.
You can learn about all these by going through the tbl menu option. It's good when you don't remember a keybinding like I do.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not find the formula debugger very helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>I had trouble when my table only had one line of data. The range
confused the program.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need to, you can export your table to a csv file.</p></li>
<li><p>Being very specific in formulas helps a lot. There are some
shortcuts for cell descriptions, but some of them were harder to
understand and use for me. When I got specific, my formulas worked
much better.</p></li>
<li><p>The emacspeak keybindings appear to be duplicates of the org ones.</p></li>
<li><p>With simple tables, it is not too hard to review the table with speech.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really like using org for this work. My file is a text file and
easily understood and modified as needed. With a little editing of the
names, I can have a file with each month under a separate headline. I
could keep year-to-date figures as well as compare expenses on a
yearly basis. There is the potential to have a unique identifier for each field.
Tracking utility bills, for example, year over year could come in very handy.</p>

<p>#+END<sub>COMMENT</sub></p>
<p>decided to let the good old Internet help me out.</p>
<p>It turns out that my friend Flyspell uses tab completion for
completing words. I don't want to turn off Flyspell since you would
end up reading articles with many misspellings.</p>
<p>The suggestion I found was to use m-tab for completions However,
alt+tab only switched me to another window. Enter the escape key!</p>
<p>escape=tab does the trick. <code class="docutils literal">#+BEGIN_Q</code> becomes <code class="docutils literal">#+BEGIN_QUOTE</code> after
pressing escape-tab. Take that Apple. I can't do that on a Mac with a
touch bar. Fortunately, I am not using one for this Linux installation.</p>

<p>I preached this sermon at the Common Table service at First Baptist
Madison on May 22, 2016. In that format, I had slides with the
Scripture readings which I included in the sermon. I have modified
this form of my homily to make more sense as an article. It may well
be that it was a part of a series on listening and being heard.</p>
<p>I am speaking to you today in the name of Jesus. Amen.</p>
<p>In his email this week, Jason called me our resident theologian. I'm going to claim this title and talk to you today about the Trinity.</p>
<p>Now that half the congregation has left and the rest of you have pulled out your phones and are catching up on Facebook or Snap Chatting your friends, let me tell you that the Trinity makes it possible for us to listen for Jesus' voice today.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the Bible speaks of God's voice. I'm going to go through some examples rather quickly. The Scripture quotations are from my new favorite translation: The Common English Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When God began to create the heavens and the earth— the earth was
without shape or form, it was dark over the deep sea, and God’s wind
swept over the waters— God said, “Let there be light.” And so light
appeared. – Genesis 1:1-3</p>
</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.</div>
<div class="line">The Word became flesh and made his home among us. We have seen his glory, glory like that of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth – John 1:1, 14</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He is our God,</div>
<div class="line">    and we are the people of his pasture,</div>
<div class="line">    the sheep in his hands</div>
<div class="line">If only you would listen to his voice right now! – Psalm 95:7</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>My sheep listen to my voice. I know them and they follow me. – John 10:27</p>
</blockquote>
<!--  -->
<blockquote>
<p>Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed a time
of peace. God strengthened the church, and its life was marked by
reverence for the Lord. Encouraged by the Holy Spirit, the church continued to grow in numbers. – Acts 9:31 Common English Bible (CEB)</p>
<p>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace
and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the
comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied. – Acts 9:31 English Standard Version (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I gave you the verse from Acts in two translations to show you some different ways of speaking about what the Holy Spirit does:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>encourage</p></li>
<li><p>comfort</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The author of Acts paints an idyllic picture–one we all hope for in our church and often despair of. There is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>peace</p></li>
<li><p>strength</p></li>
<li><p>comfort</p></li>
<li><p>encouragement</p></li>
<li><p>reverence</p></li>
<li><p>increase.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this something that only happened long ago and 21st century Christians in Madison, Wisconsin have no access to this strengthening and encouragement?</p>
<p>The good news: We have the same access and can have the same experience as those who have gone before us. The church described in Acts can be our church today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have much more to say to you, but you can’t handle it now. However,
when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you in all truth. He
won’t speak on his own, but will say whatever he hears and will
proclaim to you what is to come. He will glorify me, because he will
take what is mine and proclaim it to you. Everything that the Father
has is mine. That’s why I said that the Spirit takes what is mine and
will proclaim it to you. – John 16:12-15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we have the Trinity at work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>God is mighty to save us.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus tells and shows us who God is and what God does.</p></li>
<li><p>The Holy Spirit enables us to show and tell others about Jesus.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Work of the Holy Spirit</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>guiding or leading us so we don't feel we're alone</p></li>
<li><p>reminding us what Jesus said and did</p></li>
<li><p>prompting us into new ways of thinking and acting on Jesus' behalf</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraging us when we become disheartened and dispirited</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>Ways to Listen for Jesus</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Have you noticed how much energy is in this room? The Holy Spirit is here, enlivening each one of us, igniting our enthusiasm for our work together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preaching</p>
<p>Hear Jesus' voice through the message every week. Participate in the discussion afterwards. Talk to someone about it during our fellowship time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scripture</p>
<p>Read the Bible. NoThe Common English Bible is written for a seventh grader. If you don't understand what you are reading, (The Ethiopian eunuch didn't know and I certainly didn't when I started), ask someone in this room. If that person can't help you, keep asking until you get an answer that makes sense to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather</p>
<p>Listening for Jesus is not just a solo activity. It is a communal one, too. We don't just gather together to hang out, but we gather to interact with one another and listen for Jesus through other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pray</p>
<p>We have ways for you to pray at our tables along the wall. There are word prayers all over the internet if you can't find the words yourself. Ask someone to pray with you during our prayer time, afterwards or as an ongoing prayer partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sing</p>
<p>Learn the songs we sing here by heart. I'm sure you can find them on YouTube or your favorite streaming music service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Turn</p>
<p>That's what I've got. Now it's time for you to speak.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I didn't have a great set up for spellchecking in Emacs. Ispell works,
but often there are too many choices and Emacspeak does not read them
out. So I investigated Flyspell and now I have a working solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hook">
<h2>The Hook</h2>
<p>I now have flyspell working in all text and text-derived buffers by
adding this hook:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">&lt;string&gt;</span>, line 14)</p>
<p>Cannot find pygments lexer for language "example"</p>

   (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)

<p>This can be disabled in specific circumstances if needed but this is
beyond the scope of this article.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedure-to-correct-words-in-a-buffer">
<h2>Procedure to Correct Words in a Buffer</h2>
<p>There are keybindings to autocorrect in <code class="docutils literal">flyspell</code>, but this is not
always advisable.</p>
<p>I needed to be able to scroll through the many options. <code class="docutils literal">Ispell</code> gives
choices with numbers, but often there are too many to give you the
list. By putting the following command in my <code class="docutils literal">init.el</code> file via the
customization menus, I am now able to use <code class="docutils literal">flyspell</code> to cursor up and
down a list until I find the right choice. After that, I can just hit return.</p>
<p>If auditory icons is turned on and you are using the default theme,
you will hear something like a rattling sound when you misspell a word. To
correct the word immediately,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>move point to the misspelled word.</p></li>
<li><p>Press c-c $. (control plus c then s plus 4)</p></li>
<li><p>Emacspeak will say menu. You can use your cursor keys to scroll up
and down the list of suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>Press return on your selection.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As well as misspelled word suggestions, you can save your word in a
personal dictionary, accept your spelling for this session or accept
all misspelled words in the buffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spellchecking-the-buffer">
<h2>Spellchecking the Buffer</h2>
<p>c-, (control plus comma) can move point from misspelled word to
misspelled word in your buffer. Press c-c $ to correct each one. c-,
will announce when you reach the end of the buffer. Press c-, again to
move to the beginning of the buffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-correction">
<h2>Automatic Correction</h2>
<p>There are other commands which can move point and automatically
correct your misspellings. Since this is automatic, the first choice
may not be the correct one. Once the word has been corrected, you will
need to reread your work to find it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tip">
<h2>Tip</h2>
<p>When moving from misspelled word to misspelled word in your buffer,
Emacspeak will not read out the new misspelled word. Press c-e w to
hear the word. Press c-e w again to have it spelled.</p>

<p>I don't know that I am going to write a proper flash sermon on this,
but I can't help thinking about the vineyard in Isaiah 5 and Psalm 80.
They are the assigned texts for the Revised Common Lectionary for
Track 1 Year C.</p>
<p>I have read these texts often since I usually review them for John 15
"I am the vine and you are the branches".</p>
<p>One of the things that continues to surprise me while reading the
parable in Isaiah 5 is the violence of God's actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>taking away its hedge</p></li>
<li><p>making it a wasteland</p></li>
<li><p>not providing any rain</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some translations, there is a distinction between grapes and bad
fruit. A better way to think of this is cultivated grapes and wild
grapes.. Some translations maintain this distinction which is helpful.</p>
<p>The plantings, the vines, are identified as the people. Their crop is
not the tasty grapes but the wild grapes of oppression and injustice.
That is what is making God angry.</p>
<p>Here God is saying that God created an environment for justice and
freedom. Instead, God finds an environment of injustice and, in some
translations, bloodshed.</p>
<p>The parable begins with the writer saying that he or she is singing a
song to his/her beloved. The singer is on the side of justice and
righteousness along with God, but as prophet, he/she is pointing out
the state of the people as God sees them.</p>
<p>These chapters we have been reading as part of the lectionary really
point out God's frustration at the people who claim to worship God but
behave counter to God's intentions for humanity.</p>

<p>I have been trying to read a psalm every day. My Old Testament
professor Dr. Robinson said it would change my life. He said that
twenty years ago (that's a scary thought in and of itself). I've never
succeeded at doing this, but it's never too late to give it a shot. I
would read all the psalms twice through in one year.</p>
<p>I've been suggesting we read a psalm at the end of our Bible study on
Thursdays. I don't do it every week, but it turns out one of the
participants doesn't like the psalms. I realized that reading one
every week allows us to work through all 150 psalms over time (three
years or so) without getting bogged down in the book of psalms. That
would make things easier for the participant who doesn't like them.
Someone is marking them off as we go.</p>
<p>This is a long introduction to reading Psalm 64. I started at Psalm 61
because that is the psalm we read last Thursday and it seemed to be a
good place to start. The problem of embarking on such a task is that
I've read Psalm 1 a lot and never gotten very far after that.</p>
<p>I can't remember ever reading Psalm 64 before. No doubt I have, but
nothing stood out to mean. This morning, however, in the wake of the
terrible shootings at El Paso and Youngstown, I couldn't help thinking of
all those bullets or, as the psalmist put it, arrows.</p>
<p>David is talking about words, not literal weapons, but it doesn't much matter in the
context of the psalm. Behind the bullets were evil words. And evil
words and hatred are at the crux of the problem in this country. It
there weren't so many evil words flying about like arrows, people
shopping on a Saturday morning for school supplies or going out for a
fun-filled evening wouldn't be dead–terrible! Unspeakable evil!</p>
<p>I take comfort in verse 8:</p>
