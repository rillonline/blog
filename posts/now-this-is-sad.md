I have worked steadily for a number of days trying to get `ablog` to
work. I followed several tutorials, spent a long time on
[readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.io) and almost had it. But then I
wanted to change a little here and a little there and well, I never
could get it to work again.

Now this is probably not `ablog's` fault. I don't understand `Sphinx`
and I'm a little shaky with restructured text, but I can get [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyter-book.org) to work so I don't understand what
happened here.  It looked so simple!
