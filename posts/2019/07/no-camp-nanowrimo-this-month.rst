   I was going to participate in *Camp Nanowrimo* this year. I like
setting a low writing goal and meeting it. Call it childish if you
like, but positive reinforcement is fun.

But I wanted to do something more than just write a first draft and so I
was leery of making a commitment I couldn't keep. Again, seeing a
congratulatory message on my screen is quite satisfying.

Here's what I really want to do:

-  Edit my Kearsarge novel. I wrote it as part of *Nanowrimo* some time
   ago and have never finished an edit. I would like to be able to give
   it to an editor and create an ebook out of it with a cover and
   everything.
-  Publish Kearsarge to my *Github* site with each chapter as a separate
   web page linked together. (Right now, I don't know how to do this. I
   am refreshing my knowledge of orgmode and learning new features.)
-  Finish writing my memoir piece on Chance so that Cindy can look it
   over before I send it off to Joy.

I have already set up *Nikola* to deploy my blog and associated pages to
*Github*.
