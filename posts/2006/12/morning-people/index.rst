   I have never been a morning person. I can get up. I can do what is
necessary, however, I am not a morning person.

Today I was awakened at 5:30 a.m. with Frank Sanatra singing about
coffee in Brazil. A bit jarring. Big band orchestration but not a young
Sanatra singing. I stagger out of bed and start looking for clothes. The
instructor arrives with food and with instructions.

"What?"

"Here's a heart guard pill. Take it from your shoulder down to your dog
and tell him 'Take it.'"

Something new at 5:30 am?

My responses must have been genetic. II sounded just like my mother in
the morning. I usually don't sound like her, but in the morning ...

Well, she'll have to come and search the floor. I dropped the pill while
trying to give it to a very excited dog.

Note to self: Be more firm with Elwood. He can obey even before
breakfast. We have different mothers.
